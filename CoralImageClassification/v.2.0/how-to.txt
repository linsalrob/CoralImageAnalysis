1. We start by generating the data from the images that we already know.

This takes the directory with all the files (or subdirectories straight from ATRIS) and the file that has Dave's format for the classifications. We output a tab separated matrix

python ../src/analyzeDZImages.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/WLH1 -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsA.txt  > WLH1.output.txt

Note that we also do this for all the images, and we will use these later in the analysis

python ../src/analyzeDZImages.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/WLH1 -a > WLH1.allimages.txt

2. We import that data into R and use the randomForest to classify the images. At this point, we can also plot the prediction of these images.

Rscript ../src/randomForest.r WLH1.output.txt

This creates a variable importance plot in the folder called png, and also creates the output file called 'WLH1.output.txt.probabilities.txt'. This latter file has the predictions of those images.

3. Next, we use python and matplotlib to plot the probability of classification using an average of 20 images in a sliding window:

python ../src/plot_predictions.py -f WLH1.output.txt.probabilities.txt -o WLH1.png


4: TODO

I need to write the Rscript to take the randomForest and predict the outcome for all images.
