executonDir
===================

This is the folder which commands should be executed from.  
It contains empty subfolders which the program requires for successful execution.  
As the commands are executed, the program will store various pieces of information in these folders.  

The files 'bundleScript.py' and 'bundleScript_Refactor.py' are both experimental scripts for running the entire 'program' in a single command.  
'bundleScript.py' uses the old implementations of the scripts, i.e. the ones written in R.
'bundleScript_Refactor.py' uses some new implementaitons of the scripts. i.e. ones which have been rewritten into Python.
