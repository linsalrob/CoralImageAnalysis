src_refactor
===================

This folder contains both new source code and copies of old source code.
New source code is labeled with the ending _Refactor.
There are also small programs for testing the results of the 'refactored' versions against the results of the old versions.


The following programs should all work:
-------------------
- analyzeDZImages_Refactor.py
- featureDetection_Refactor.py
- randomForest_Refactor.py
- randomForestPredictNoTrim_Refactor.py
- randomForestProbabilityCompare.py
- randomForestPredictNoTrimProbabilityCompare.py
