v.3.0
===================
Latest version of Edwards Lab Coral Image Analysis project
-------------------
This verison of the program aims to achieve program execution by modifing and extending the code in the original v.2.0 fork from 'linsalrob/CoralImageAnalysis'.

Project goals are as follows:
- Rewrite non-python sections into python
- Bundle functionality into a single 'executable' function
- Rewrite funcitons to be 'generic' and allow for the program to be used on other, similar types of data.
- Produce a GUI for functionality, allowing easy use
