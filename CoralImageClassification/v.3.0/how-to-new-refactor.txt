Notes before execution:
This project is intended for execution on the Edwards server, specifically rambox.
However, there is the packaged virtual python environment 'ramboxEnv' which should be able to emulate all the necessary modules.
To execute this project it is necessary to have virtualenv installed.
Note: If you are executing this on the Edwards server, I still recommend using the 'ramboxEnv' because the server's python modules are out of date and cause problems with execution.
The new program uses'.tsv' to better describe what the files are, however, they are fundamentally the same.

A more detailed discussion of what each of these commands do is available in the 'how-to-old.txt'.  This file is just a guide for the execution of the program.

In addition, to run the program requires the 'Zawada' folder and all of its subdirectories be present within the 'data' folder.
These are not included with the github package, and should be obtained from Rob.


Step 1: 
	Navigate to the directory 'executionDir'
Step 2: 
	Activate your virtual python environment by using the following command: 
	source ../ramboxEnv/bin/activate

Step 3:
	python ../src/analyzeDZImages.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/WLH1 -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsA.txt  -o WLH1.output.tsv

Step 4:
	python ../src/analyzeDZImages.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/WLH1 -a -o WLH1.allimages.tsv

Step 5:
	python ../src/analyzeDZImages.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/WLH1 -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsA.txt -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsB.txt -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsB_1_3.txt -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsC.txt -f /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/PROCESSED/WLH1/WLH1_classificationsD.txt -o WLH1.all.tsv -a

Step 6:
	python ../src/featureDetection.py -d /data/Zawada/ATRIS_images/ELH2/ -o ELH2.features.tsv

Step 7:
	Note: ELH2.all.txt is an included file, which came from the 'previous_analysis'
 	directory.  I am unsure how this file was generated, and have not been able to
 	locate much information about what it describes.
	I have included a copy of 'ELH2.all.txt' in the execution directory.

	perl ../src/join.pl ELH2.features.tsv ELH2.all.tsv > ELH2.all.features.tsv

Step 8:
	Rscript ../src/randomForest.r WLH1.output.tsv

Step 9:
	Note: LHM5.all.txt is an included file, which came from the 'previous_analysis'
 	directory.  I am unsure how this file was generated, and have not been able to 		locate much information about what it describes.
	I have included a copy of 'LHM5.all.txt' in the execution directory.

	Rscript ../src/randomForestTrainPredict.r LHM5.all.tsv

Step 10: 
	Rscript  ../src/randomForestTrainPredictNoTrim.r ELH2.all.features.tsv

Step 11: 
	python ../src/plot_predictions.py -f WLH1.output.probabilities.tsv -o WLH1.png

Step 12: 
	perl ../src/concatenate.pl *all.features.tsv > all.all.tsv
